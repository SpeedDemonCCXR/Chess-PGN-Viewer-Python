# Chess-PGN-Viewer-Python
A simple PGN viewer that asks the user to input a valid chess game PGN and opens the PGN in a board. An overview of what each .py file does:
* Main_Window.py → This displays the main window with the text box for the game PGN and validates if the PGN is valid or not.
* Board.py → Displays the actual board, pieces, player names and forward/backward buttons.
* Notation.py → Displays the notation frame with the moves and move number
* Key_Bindings.py → Implements necessary key bindings (Forward arrow/Backward arrow)
